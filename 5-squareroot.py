"""squareroot.py is a program that takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root.
it achieves this by use of a function called sqrt. An output example would be The square root of 14.5 is approx. 3.8."""


#BELOW IN THE COMMENTS IS MY ORIGINAL SOLUTION TO THE NEWTON'S THEORY QUESTION.
#THEN I REALIZED IT DIDN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION AS IT USES PYTHON'S INBUILT FUNCTION
#PYTHON'S math.sqrt INBUILT FUNCTION IS THE EASIEST WAY TO GET THE SQUARE ROOT.
#IT CAN BE ROUNDED DOWN WITH THE INBUILT round FUNCTION.
